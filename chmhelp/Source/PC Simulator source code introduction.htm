<h1>PC Simulator Source Code documentation</h1><br><br>

This topic documents extensively about the PC Simulator source code.<br><br>

However, starting from version 1.7, the scripting backend was switched to <a href="https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/IL2CPP.html">il2cpp</a>, meaning that features that are implemented from version 1.7 and onwards are reference only.
