The left textbox is where you put your encrypted/decrypted texts to decrypt/encrypt.<br>
The right textbox is where the encrypted/decrypted files get decrypted/encrypted.<br><br>

The "Select Save File" button is where you select the files to decrypt/encrypt if you dont want to copy-paste.<br>
The "Save to..." button is where after you are done with the output text, you can save it to a save file. Do note here, that it is automatically decrypted/encrypted.<br><br>

The "Copy to clipboard" button copies the output text to the clipboard.<br>
The "Guide" button is self-explanitory.
